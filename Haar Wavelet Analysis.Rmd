#Background Motivation
 I will be working to create code that will analyze a signal using Haar Wavelets. I am doing this in order to pick out features of signals that may be used as inputs into a neural network I will construct at a later point. 

```{r}

```



```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
